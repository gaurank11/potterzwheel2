          <p>
            Living in a small space doesnâ€™t mean you have to compromise on comfort and style. With the right design strategies, you can make the most of every square foot.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Use Multifunctional Furniture</h3>
          <p>
            Invest in pieces that serve multiple purposes, like a bed with storage underneath or a foldable dining table.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Utilize Vertical Space</h3>
          <p>
            Shelves, wall hooks, and hanging storage can free up floor space and keep things organized.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Optimize Lighting</h3>
          <p>
            Good lighting makes a room feel larger. Use mirrors to reflect natural light and create an airy feel.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Declutter Regularly</h3>
          <p>
            Keep only essential items and find creative storage solutions to avoid a cramped space.
          </p>
        </>
