          <p>
            Install LED lighting, energy-efficient appliances, and smart thermostats to reduce energy consumption.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Use Sustainable Materials</h3>
          <p>
            Opt for eco-friendly materials like bamboo flooring, recycled wood, and non-toxic paints.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Reduce Water Usage</h3>
          <p>
            Install water-saving fixtures and rainwater harvesting systems to minimize waste.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Grow Indoor Plants</h3>

            Plants not only enhance aesthetics but also improve air quality by filtering pollutants.
